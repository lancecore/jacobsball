# Jacob's Ball - A silly toy for my son

A simple PWA built using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and [use-sound](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/use-sound). Icons and splash screens were generated using [pwa-asset-generator](https://github.com/elegantapp/pwa-asset-generator), and the bubbles icon is from [Sensa's emoji set](https://sensa.co/emoji).

## Background
I was playing around with use-sound, making a logo grow in size and play a sound with an increasing sound rate on every click. My son walked into the office and was really amused by this, so I turned that logo into this quick project. He doesn't really get any screen time, and he's too young to properly tap to make it work, but it gave us a few minutes of fun while tapping it with him.
